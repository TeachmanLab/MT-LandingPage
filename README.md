# MT-LandingPage

This is based off of a Bootstrap startup landing page.  The rest of the readme focuses on this.
To make this easy to deploy in the one place we have some control over on our servers, i've added
a make_war.sh script that will generate a very simple war file we can use to deploy the application.
just run the script, and copy the resulting landing.war to our production server, then move it
into the deployment directory.  Have a great day!

### Basic Usage

After downloading, simply edit the HTML and CSS files included with the template in your favorite text editor to make changes. These are the only files you need to worry about, you can ignore everything else! To preview the changes you make to the code, you can open the `index.html` file in your web browser.

### Advanced Usage

Be sure you have gulp-cli installed to the latest version
```bash
npm i gulp-cli -g
```

After installation, run `npm install` and then run `gulp dev` which will open up a preview of the template in your default browser, watch for changes to core template files, and live reload the browser when changes are saved. You can view the `gulpfile.js` to see which tasks are included with the dev environment.
